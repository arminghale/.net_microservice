# .NET Project - Identity Service

## Overview
Welcome to the "Identity Service" project, where we make managing users, roles, and tenants look like a breeze (or at least we hope so). This .NET-based microservice is the superhero your multi-tenant environment deserves. It handles the tough stuff like user and role management, tenant isolation, and access control so you can focus on the fun stuff—like naming your tenants after your favorite TV shows.

## Features

### Identity Service
- **User Management**: Handle CRUD operations for users because users love creating and deleting themselves (or maybe that's just developers).
- **Role Management**: Define roles that make your users feel important, or not—your call.
- **Tenant Management**: Multi-tenant support because sharing is caring, but isolation is safer.
- **Dynamic Access Control**: 
  - Users can juggle multiple roles. Why settle for one role when you can have them all?
  - Access to actions and services is either through roles or direct user permissions. Because flexibility is key (and so are permissions).

### Messaging
- **Kafka Configurations**: Prepped and ready for when your microservices decide they actually want to talk to each other. Currently just chilling.

### File Storage
- **MinIO Integration**: Store files efficiently, because stuffing them under the digital rug is so last season.

### Caching
- **Redis Cache**: Redis takes the "wait" out of "wait for it..." by speeding things up.

### Communication
- **SMS and Email Notifications**: Annoy your users—err, keep them informed—with timely SMS and email messages.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable, efficient, and probably your database of choice unless you're a fan of chaos.

### Architecture
- **Repository Pattern**: A clean codebase is a happy codebase. We use repositories to keep things nice and tidy.

## Future Plans
- Integration of additional microservices with Kafka-based messaging (because one service is just the beginning).
- Enhanced logging and monitoring because someone has to keep an eye on all this magic.
- Advanced features for tenant and user analytics. Fancy graphs, anyone?
